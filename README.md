ML LR model to predict hardness property of High Entropy Alloy


In this tutorial we will learn to create an ML model for hardness property prediction for high entropy alloys. We will go through the following steps:

* Load training dataset and separate X and y columns
* Visualize the alloy property and feature data
* Use scikit-learn library to build alloy hardness prediction model (linear regression)
* Model assessment, cross-validation
* Polynomial regression
* Regularization using CV


The dataset for this project is taken from the following publication:

Wen, Cheng, et al. "Machine learning assisted design of high entropy alloys with desired property." Acta Materialia 170 (2019): 109-117 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actamat.2019.03.010).
